# Online Food Ordering System (MVP)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **Online Food Ordering Website** developed as a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** within a limited time frame.  
The goal of the project is to provide a simple and functional system that allows users to browse food menus, place orders, and track order status, while enabling the restaurant administrator to manage foods, users, orders, and costs.

Due to time constraints and MVP scope, the project was implemented using a **simple architecture** without applying complex patterns such as MVC.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Traditional food ordering methods (phone calls or in-person ordering) often cause:
- Time consumption for customers and restaurants
- Human errors in order registration
- Lack of order tracking
- Poor centralized management of users and orders

There is a need for a **simple online system** that allows customers to place orders easily and enables restaurant administrators to manage all operations centrally.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
To address these issues, a web-based food ordering system was designed with two main sections:
1. **User Panel** for browsing food, placing orders, and tracking order status
2. **Admin Panel** for managing foods, users, orders, discounts, and delivery costs

The system focuses on core functionalities and delivers a working MVP.
